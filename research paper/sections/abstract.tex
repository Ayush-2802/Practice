\begin{abstract}
This research presents an innovative approach to predictive maintenance for industrial slitting machines using IoT sensor data and machine learning techniques. We developed a hybrid forecasting system that combines time series analysis with supervised learning to predict equipment failures before they occur. The system was implemented and tested on a slitting machine used in packaging film manufacturing, with sensors collecting tension, pressure, width, and diameter measurements at one-second intervals. Our hybrid model employs Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecasting integrated with supervised classification algorithms to enable real-time monitoring and prediction of machine failures. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieved 89\% accuracy in predicting quality issues and potential failures up to 45 minutes before occurrence, providing sufficient time for corrective actions. This research contributes to the evolving field of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) by offering a practical implementation that can significantly reduce unplanned downtime and maintenance costs in manufacturing environments.
